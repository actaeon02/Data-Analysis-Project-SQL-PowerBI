Business Request: Enhancing Internet Sales Reports with Visual Dashboards

Hello Steven,

I trust this message finds you in good spirits.

We have identified a need to enhance our internet sales reports by transitioning from static reports to dynamic visual dashboards. The primary focus of these dashboards will be to provide comprehensive insights into our sales performance, including details on product sales, client engagement, and historical trends over time.

Given the diverse product portfolios and client bases handled by our sales team, it's imperative that the dashboards allow for easy filtering based on individual salespersons, products, and customers. This flexibility will enable a more granular analysis and better decision-making.

Additionally, to facilitate performance comparison and benchmarking, we will integrate budget data for the year 2021 into the dashboards. This will allow us to compare actual sales figures against predefined budget targets and assess performance accurately.

As part of our analytical approach, we typically analyze sales data from the past two years. Therefore, historical sales data spanning the past two years will also be included in the dashboard for comprehensive analysis and trend identification.

Please feel free to reach out if you require any further information or assistance regarding this initiative.
